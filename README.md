## Project Description

This simulation is based on a festive storyline where Santa Claus has lost his reindeer due to a snowstorm in Lapland. Using the **JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework)**, we implemented a system of intelligent agents to coordinate the rescue mission through message-based interactions.

The main learning goals include:
- Multi-agent system design
- Communication using FIPA-compliant protocols
- Trust management between agents
- Heuristic-based pathfinding in grid environments
- Use of intermediate agents (translators) for communication format handling


## Agents and Behaviours

The system involves the following agents:
- **Santa**: Validates the mission and communicates with the team.
- **Rudolph**: Provides coordinates of the lost reindeer.
- **Scout**: Main searching agent who explores the map.
- **Translator**: Interprets between Santa‚Äôs formal messages and Gen-Z slang used by Scout.

Core behaviors include:
- `HandleVolunteerRequestBehaviour`
- `HandlePositionRequestBehaviour`
- `RequestSearchBehaviour`
- `TranslationBehaviour`
- `WalkBehaviour`
- `StepBehaviour`

## Environment

The agent operates within a grid-based environment, implemented through:
- `Environment.java`
- `Map.java`
- `Node.java`
- `GridLayoutManager.java`

Search and movement strategies rely on:
- `HeuristicHandler.java`
- `WalkBehaviour.java`

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **JADE Framework** for multi-agent development
- **FIPA ACL messages** for inter-agent communication
